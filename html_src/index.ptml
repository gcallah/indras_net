  <h1>
    Indra Agent-Based Modeling System
  </h1>

  <p>
    Indra is an agent-based modeling (ABM) system built using Python,
    Javascript, Awk, Bash, and YAML. The main language for creating models 
    is Python. Javascript is used on the front-end, and the other languages
    play supporting roles.
    We've made some Jupyter notebooks to help explain how models are
    programmed in Python,
    <a
        href="https://github.com/gcallah/indras_net/blob/master/indra/InteractiveIndra.ipynb">here</a>
    and
    <a
        href="https://github.com/gcallah/indras_net/blob/master/indra/AFirstModel.ipynb">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ultimate goal is to simplify ABM creation so that a
    model can be specified in only a few lines of code, or by
    filling in a few parameters on a screen.
    To that end we are building
    <a href="webapp.html">
      a Web front-end
    </a>
    that will allow non-coders to build models, while at the same time
    permitting coders to use Python for more flexibility in model creation.  It
    will use our <a href="http://indrasnet.pythonanywhere.com">API Server</a>
    to run the models. Having the backend as an API server will permit complete 
    flexibility in front-ends: anyone can use our agent engine on the server
    with whatever front-end they choose to build.

   The name "Indra" was given to this project because its design was inspired
   by the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net">Indra's
   Net</a>.
