            This project is intended to capture the idea of capital structure,
            as presented in the works of Ludwig von Mises, Ludwig Lachmann,
            Israel Kirzner, and others.

            Austrian Business Cycle Theory(ABCT)  developed by Austrian school
            of economics views business cycle as a result of artificially low
            interest rate leading to the imbalance between saving and
            investment. Low interest rate stimulates business investment
            because of the lower cost of borrowing money. More investment bid
            up prices for capital goods increasing the cost of production along
            with the false information about sufficient recourse cause the
            uncompleted production of final products which are not capable of
            turning into profit. As a result, companies are not able to sell
            their product and a lot of resources are being wasted leading to
            an economic downturn.
