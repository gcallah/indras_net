            Introduction
        </h2>
            <p>
                Conventional wisdom from committed "free market"
                economists would have it that moves to ban
                "big box" retailers such as Walmart from certain localities
                are rebellions against consumer sovereignty 
                and must hurt consumer welfare. After all,
                if consumers did not want to shop at the big box
                retailer, they would simply not do so, correct?
                The fact that they switch their shopping to the
                big box and away from "mom-and-pop" stores
                shows they prefer the big box.

        <h2>
            Theoretical Considerations
        </h2>
            <p>
                This paper attempts to show that the above
                analysis is simplistic.  We present a model
                in which all consumers have the following 
                preference ordering in some retail sector:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Have both local shops and a big box store.
                <li>Have only local shops.
                <li>Have only a big box store.
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                (We can further assume they know the costs of achieving 1, 2,
                or 3: they want 1 even if they sometimes pay higher prices to
                achieve it compared to 3, i.e., we could add a monthly
                shopping bill to each of the above.)
            </p>

            <p>
                We then show that, under not outrageous assumptions,
                it is easy for consumers, in trying to achieve their
                first preference, to instead wind up with their third.
                This is due to consumers facing a collective action
                problem, as well as a knowledge problem:
                Consumers might, if they had perfect knowledge
                of the exit points of the local shops and the ability
                to finely coordinate their own shopping with that of others,
                be able to achieve their first preference
                (a mix of big box and mom-and-pop shopping available). But,
                in general, consumers have little knowledge of
                what percentage reduction in sales will cause a small shop
                to exit the industry, nor do they have very much
                ability to coordinate their shopping with other consumers.
                (The latter means that even if consumers
                forego a certain amount of shopping
                at the big box stores, which they would otherwise do, simply to
                keep the small stores solvent, they cannot ensure their
                neighbors will do the same. So their rational choice is to
                "defect" and shop at the big box store as often as they wish,
                regardless of the impact on the small shops.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, since they cannot fine tune their shopping to achieve 1),
                they shop at the big box store whenever it suits them for a particular
                purchase, without regards to the "macro" effects of their
                choices. (See Schelling, 2006, for extensive analysis of the
                potential gap between micromotives and macrobeahvior.)
                They shift "too" much of their shopping to the big
                box, with the end result is that all of 
                the mom-and-pops are driven out of business,
                despite no consumer wanting that result. Thus, 
                it <i>might</i> make sense, faced with such knowledge and
                game theoretic difficulties, for consumers to
                bind themselves in advance to 2), by banning a,
                or some, or all, big box stores, or to trying to
                achieve 1) by, say, forcing big box retailers to
                locate well outside the center of town, making trips
                to them less convenient. (All legislation has unintended
                consequences, which is why we make the weak claim that 
                these types of actions <i>might</i> make sense: such
                legislation might also, for instance, serve the interest of an
                inefficient local monopolist seeking to protect its privileged
                position in a market.)
            </p>
            <h3>
                Predatory Pricing
            </h3>
            <p>
                We further suggest that our model may actually capture the
                mechanism underlying the intuition of the existence of
                "predatory pricing." As has often been noted, the idea that
                big box stores engage in predatory pricing to drive out small
                competitors and then jack up the prices to achieve high profits
                has an obvious problem: once the prices charged by the big box
                stores have been raised, why don't the small competitors simply
                reenter the market? (See, for instance, DiLorenzo, 1992.)
                <br>
                <br>
                Our model avoids this pitfall: the big box stores do not need
                to set prices artificially low for a time: they can rely
                on their greater financial resources to ride out the period
                during which <b>all</b> stores will be losing money, and once their
                smaller competitors have exited, they can keep their prices right
                where they were, and now be profitable. And new smaller
                competitors will not enter the market, since that would merely
                reestablish the situation in which all stores are losing money.
                Furthermore, our model has the advantage that we need not posit
                any vicious intent on the part of big-box retailers: they need
                not be <i>intending</i> to drive small retailers out of
                business. They just know that in a year or so, their new outlet
                will be making plenty of money.

            <p>
                We note here that what we are describing, in suggesting the
                possibility that some restriction on big-box retailing might be
                rational, is an example of the general class of "constitutional
                constraints" described by Jon Elster in <i>Ulysses Unbound</i>
                (2000): we want to listen to the Sirens, but we know that if we
                do not tie ourselves to the mast in advance, we will not merely
                listen, but fall prey to their sweet song. Or, to consider
                more mundane circumstances, by the sober light of day, we
                realize that we do not want to find ourselves in a bar at 4 AM,
                but we also recognize that in the bar at 1 AM, we will not be thinking so
                clearly. So we mandate a bar closing time. Similarly, we don't
                want our own speech suppressed, but recognize 
                that in power we might
                give in to the temptation to suppress speech we don't like, and
                that others in power might do so to us. So we pass the first
                amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

        <h2>
            Model Design 
        </h2>
            <p>
                In order to see if our notion is theoretically plausible,
                we create a model populated by two basic types of agents:
                consumers (C), and retailers (R). Retailers are further
                classed as mom-and-pops (M) or big-boxes (B).
                The mom-and-pops each supply a
                specific type of good, such as hardware or groceries.
                The big-boxes provide every sort of good.
                At first the environment is occupied by
                only Ms and Cs. Each supplies something the other needs: the
                consumers supply money to the mom-and-pop stores, and they
                supply goods to the consumers. Rs receive a periodic
                endowment of goods "from heaven" (which is a parameter),
                while Cs have the same thing happen in
                regards to money. Cs shop in turn at each stores selling each
                type of good they need. If Rs run out of money, they disappear.
                Without big box competitors, we discover an equilibrium can
                exist so that a certain number of Ms can remain in business.
            </p>

            <p>
                At a certain point in the running of our model, the Bs appear.
                They have a much larger initial endowment of money
                then do the Ms.
                The Cs want to shop at both types of retailer
                (how much they like each is again a parameter),
                and split their acquisition of goods (according to that
                parameter) between the two types of retailers.
                (In order to illustrate the thesis of our paper, that consumer
                behavior may thwart consumer preferences, we have run our model
                with consumers preferring the mom-and-pops by as much as
                four-to-one, and have still gotten a result where the small
                shops disappear.)
                This split may cause the funds of both types of
                agents to dwindle. But as the Bs have a much greater
                initial endowment, they are able to survive this period
                of coexistence, while the Ms gradually disappear.
                We are left with an environment of only Bs and Cs,
                which the Cs did <em>not</em> want. Thus, given 
                simple but not outrageous assumptions, our model
                shows our story above is plausible: it has what Weber
                would call "explanatory adequacy." Empirical work
                would be necessary to decide whether it has Weberian "causal
                adequacy." (See Callahan and Horwitz, 2010, for a brief
                description of the difference between the two concepts in
                Weber.)

                    Indra is an agent based modeling (ABM) system built in Python. Our model
                    runs on it, and so it would be valuable
                    to review its

                <ul>
                    <li>Looping over agents randomly, in order, in reverse

            <h3>
                Implementing the Big Box Model in Indra
            </h3>
                <h4>
                    Overview
                </h4>
                    <p>
                        In addition to running on the base framework of
                        agents and environments, our model includes Indra's Markov classes.
                        These allow our Consumers to display
                        psuedorandom shopping behavior according to the logic of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chains</a>. 
                        These Consumers choose to either buy from a 
                        MomAndPop Retailer or a BigBox retailer;
                        their preference is decided by use of a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix">transition matrix</a>.
                        When an agent sees a collection of stores he could
                        possibly go to, he needs some way to choose. Let's say
                        we define his preferences so that when there are
                        multiple places to go, he goes to a mom and pop about
                        70% of the time and to a big box 30% of the time. An
                        option to simulate this is to generate random numbers:
                        If a random number between 0.0 and 1.0 is less than 0.7,
                        the agent goes to the mom and pop; otherwise he goes to
                        the big box. We can do this by use of
                        Indra's Markov classes, which provide the capability
                        to work with a large array of phenomena that are, or,
                        at least, look like, Markov processes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way we read the transition matrix is as follows.
                        Our Consumer sees that there are both MomAndPop and
                        BigBox retailers who sell his desired good. Further, he has
                        a predilection for the MomAndPops such that he
                        goes to them about 70% of the time;
                        leaving the remaining 30% of shopping for
                        the BigBox stores.
                    </p>

                <h4>
                    Model Details
                </h4>
                    <p>
                        Let us look, first, at the behavior of consumers, and
                        then, briefly, at the simpler behavior of retailers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When a <b>consumer</b> acts,
                        he surveys the world around him, evaluates his world on
                        the basis of this survey, and he responds according to

                        The way the consumer surveys his
                        environment goes like this: he finds all the stores
                        he can view (a view which happens to be the whole
                        environment this model) and he only remembers the
                        stores which sell the good he wants.

                        Consumers obtain their prehension from the
                        Environment. We build a 2x1 matrix. The (1,1) 
                        entry represents the agent's chance of going to
                        a <code>mom_and_pop</code>, and the (1,2) entry 
                        is that of the <code>big_box</code>. If a type is
                        not in the agents neighborhood, we cannot go there.
                        Since this means there may be a zero entry, we 
                        must normalize the vector. For the column must sum to
                        1, according to the idea of a transition matrix.
