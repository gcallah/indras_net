            Why It Might Be Rational to Restrict Big Box Retailers
        </h1>

        <h2>
            Theoretical Considerations
        </h2>
            <p>
                Conventional wisdom from doctrinaire
                “free market” economists would have it that
                moves to ban “big box” retailers such as Walmart from certain localities
                are rebellions against consumer sovereignty and must hurt consumer
                welfare. After all, if consumers did not want to shop at the big box
                retailer, they would simply not do so, correct? The fact that they
                switch their shopping to the big box and away from “mom-and-pop” stores
                shows they prefer the big box.
            </p>
            <p>
                This paper attempts to show that such analysis is simplistic. We present
                a model in which all consumers have the following preference ordering in
                some retail sector:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Have both local shops and the big box store.
                <li> Have only local shops.
                <li> Have only the big box store.
            </ol>
            <p>
                We then show that, under not outrageous assumptions, it is easy for
                consumers, in trying to achieve their first preference, to instead wind
                up with their third. This is due to consumers facing a prisoner’s
                dilemma, as well as knowledge problems: Consumers might, if they had
                perfect knowledge of the exit points of the local shops and the ability
                to finely coordinate their own shopping, be able to achieve their first
                preference (a mix of big box and mom-and-pop shopping available). But,
                in general consumers have little knowledge of how much sales must be
                reduced before a small shop will exit the industry, nor do they have
                very much ability to coordinate their shopping with other consumers.
                Therefore, since they cannot fine tune their shopping to achieve 1),
                they shop at the big box store whenever it suits them for a particular
                purchase, without regards to the “macro” effects of their choices. The
                end result is that all of the mom-and-pops are driven out of business,
                despite no consumer wanting that result. Thus, it may make sense, faced
                with such knowledge and game theoretic difficulties, for consumers to
                bind themselves in advance to 2), by banning a, or some, or all, big box
                stores, or to trying to achieve 1) by, say, forcing big box
                retailers to locate well outside the center of town, making
                trips to them less convenient.

        <h2>
            Model Design 
        </h2>
            <p>
                We create a model populated by three types of agents:
                consumers (C), mom-and-pops (M), and big-boxers (B).
                At first "space" is occupied by only M and C. each supply
                something the other needs to continue in existence: the
                consumers supply money to the mom-and-pop stores, who supply
                goods to the consumers. Ms receive a periodic endowment of
                goods "from heaven," while Cs have the same thing happen in
                regards to money. When Cs supply of goods runs low, they move
                to Ms to replenish it. If Ms run out of money, they disappear.
            </p>

            <p>
                At some point in the progress of the model, the Bs appear. They
                have a much larger initial endowment of money then do the Ms.
                The Cs like both equally well, and split their acquisition of
                goods between the two types of agents. This causes the money
                supply of both types of agents to dwindle. But as the Bs have
                much more money to start, they are able to survive this period
                of coexistence, while all of the Ms disappear. We are left with
                an environment of only Bs and Cs, which the Cs did <em>not</em>
                want.
