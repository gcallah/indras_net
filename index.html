    Indra Agent-Based Modeling System

  <h2>
    Project Goal
  </h2>

  <p>
    Indra is an agent-based modeling (ABM) system in Python.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ultimate goal is to simplify ABM creation so that a
    model can be specified in only a few lines of code, or by
    filling in a few parameters on a screen.
    To that end we are building
    <a href="webapp.html">
      a Web front-end
    </a>
    that will
    allow non-coders to build models, while at the same time
    permitting coders to use Python for more flexibility in
    model creation.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Project Architecture
  </h2>

  <h3>
    Agents and Environments
  </h3>
  <p>
    Indra&rsquo;s structure can be appreciated philosophically. We
    start by considering the following question, What are the most
    general features of all population dynamics?
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to have a population we have to have members of that population,
    and since these members must *do* something we call them "<a
    href=https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/entity.py>agents.
    </a>" So these agents act, and action always has a definite character,
    designed to reach an end. For this reason, all agents are also assigned a
    goal. For example, sheep are agents that run away from wolves because their
    goal is to not be eaten. These agents all exist within some world defining
    the ways they may interact with other agents. For example, wolves are
    agents limited by distance. They have to reach the sheep before they can
    eat them! This world in which interaction takes place we call the "<a
                                                                           href=https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/env.py>environment</a>,"
                                                                       env for
                                                                       short.
  </p> <p> All agents act, and while respose to the external env is not strictly
  required, whenever an agent needs to know something about it's external
  world, it has to peer into its env to see what&rsquo;s about. For this
  reason, agents access information about other agents strictly through the env
  object that it lives
      in.
  </p>

  <h3>
    The User, the Menu, and the Environment
  </h3>

  <p>
    The
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/user.py">
      user
    </a>
    is of course given control to run the program and to display its data.
    But the key idea here is that the "user" appears as another node in
    Indra's net, meaning the agents can conceivably "see" the user and
    interact with him/her.
    His primary method of interface is through the
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/menu.py">
      menu
    </a>, but more complicated interactions are possible.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Agent Populations
  </h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/agent_pop.py">
      Agent pop
    </a>
    is where we record all the information about the agents in an
    active model. It supports iterating over the population of
    agents by type, in order added, in reverse of the order added,
    and randomly.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Universals and Everything
  </h3>

  <p>
    One last generality can be noted. Agents have some kind of relation to one another
    and to the env they act within. Even the user has a relation to these things. He
    called them into existence and manages everything!
    To express these connections, nearly everything in the program
    is a
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/node.py">
      node
    </a>
    in an all-encompassing graph.
    Thus everything is interconnected through
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net">
      Indra's Net.
    </a>
    And thus we may record abstract relationships of the kind similar to
    that which is in our
    mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    Universals are a type of node that relate agents to each other.
    Their use is currently suspended while we work on other aspects of
    the system.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Graphics Capabilities
  </h3>
  <p>
    We currently have fairly extensive graphics capabilities built in
    to the system through
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib">
      matplotlib.
    </a>
    These include plotting changes in agent populations, tracing agent
    movement (live) on a scatter plot, and examining the
    object-hierarchy at play in a program at any point in time.

  <p>
    Simulates fires starting and spreading through a forest. Burned out trees
    are replaced by new growth, which after aging are suseptible to catching

    like followers, and
    followers do not want to look like hipsters.
