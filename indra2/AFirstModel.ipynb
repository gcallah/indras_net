    "## A First Model Using Indra2 ##\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, the results look promising. Let's take a look at the beginnings of the first model being written based on the `indra2` library. This is a classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka–Volterra_equations\">predator-prey model</a>, often called \"wolf-sheep\" in the ABM world. The central idea is to model how populations of predators and their prey will cycle in a circumscribed environment.\n",
